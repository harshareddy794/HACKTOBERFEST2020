# Application-of-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-to-Predict-Flight-Delays
Using a machine learning model, we can predict the flight arrival delays. We can take various inputs as a row of feature vector like departure date, departure delay, the distance between the two airports, scheduled arrival time, origin airport, destination airport etc to the algorithm.  We then use decision tree classifier to predict if the flight arrival will be delayed or not. A flight is considered to be delayed when the difference between scheduled and actual arrival times is greater than 15 minutes. The model will be trained based on the features which will give the higher accuracy. Finally, it will be integrated into a web-based application. The final system allows the user to give the details of the flights as input and the system will display the output whether the flight will be late or not.
